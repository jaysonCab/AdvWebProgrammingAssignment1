The biggest thing I've learned from this project is the capabilities of Javascript within a web application allowing
you to dynamically change the page without having to reload the page. I've built my own website prior to this,
https://jaysoncabrera.ca/. I thought the extent of Javascript was simply animations and not related to inputs or
listeners, I thought if you wanted dynamic page information you required a PHP front end application. without
even a map on place, I was testing out the initial Javascript code shown in class on reading my location in commit
hash 662e153267654732be74ccf9734383283f0d0a08. From here, you could retrieve the users location and be able to
dynamically display on screen.

On a more technical end, one thing that was difficult to manage was edits within the requirements. During commit
a3315ae587df284c401cb9301e8af912d1c771d6, having to reference already created markers was a difficult task but
incredily useful to know. When adding a landmark card, I am creating an object with specific values so when I decide
to edit the entire object, it already knows what pointers to look at. It doesn't search through a list to find what the
gallery item is referencing, it already knows its reference.
